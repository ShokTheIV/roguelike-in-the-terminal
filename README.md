# roguelike-in-the-terminal
have u ever played a rogue like game inside the terminal? Well this is half finished but i think its quite impressive

you might be asking why?

well I like to create stuff that other people have not thought of, or stuff that is not recommended

like for example creating a roguelike game in a python terminal is the last thing that would come to ur mind when chosing a project to do
